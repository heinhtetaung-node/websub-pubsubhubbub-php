# websub-pubsubhubbub-php
Websub (pubsubhubbub) with php publish and scribe

Websub is a publish/scribe platform that allow scribers to receive feeds from publisher 
We can check and understand why we should use publish/scribe pattern by watching this video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6S7i91nfSg

#Implementation
1. clone this repo
2. Subscribe feed to hub
curl -X POST 'http://pubsubhubbub.appspot.com/' -d'hub.verify=sync' -d'hub.topic=youdomain.com/feed.xml' -d'hub.callback=yourdomain.com/accept.php' -d'hub.mode=subscribe' -d'hub.verify_token=test_verify_token'  -D-
So, hub will check your callback url yourdomain.com/accept.php with get method, it should be echo hub_challenge
If everything is right, it will return 204, otherwise you have error
3. If success, publish your feed to hub
open url yourdomain.com/accept.php and submit, that will publish your feed to hub
4. After publishing is finished hub will inform to your subscriber's callback url check log.txt file that will print your new xml object

#Adding new item to feed.xml
1. If you want to add new item to xml file, you can add new entry tag under <id>http://blog.superfeedr.com/</id>  line no 8
2. After adding, please publish your changes to inform hub
open url yourdomain.com/accept.php and submit, that will publish your feed to hub
3. After publishing is finished hub will inform to your subscriber's callback url check log.txt file that will print your new xml object

That's it, how easy! happy coding.
